/**
 * ## Type Variables
 * - Now... we break on through to the other side. üçÑüåå
 * - If you've used Generics you have used type arguments to define Generic types
 *   ...which are then instantiated with very specific types ex. List<int>.
 * - We are going to use type variables to create a bridge (=>) that brings values
 *   at the point of application into the type system dimension.
 * - Queue some kind of a time travel or warping sound effect.
